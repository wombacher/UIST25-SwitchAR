This repository contains the Unity project for the [SwitchAR paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3746059.3747595) published at [UIST 2025](https://uist.acm.org/2025/).
It was developed for the Meta Quest 3 with Unity version 2022.3.10f1. The avatar was downloaded from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).
As the project relies on a virtual 3D reconstruction of your physical environment, this code is not ready to go. Before it can be used, you need to add the following:
- A virtual reconstruction of your environment. We used the photogrammetry software [Reality Capture](https://www.realityscan.com/) to create our reconstruction.
- The [Unity asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/old-movie-old-film-screen-effect-270021) we used for the visual noise. We removed it from the project for copyright reasons.
- A few other assets you can replace with your own. This includes a 3D curtain, 3D picture frames and 2D painting sprites.
